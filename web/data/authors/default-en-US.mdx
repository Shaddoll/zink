## About me

I'm a software engineer living in Seattle. I graduated from Tsinghua University and Columbia Univiersity. I'm proficient in Golang, familiar with C/C++, Python, JavaScript, and know a little about Java (I hate the bloat in Java). My major work is related to distributed systems, and I'm a main contributor of [Cadence](https://github.com/uber/cadence).

I like playing video games. I'm a big fan of Soul-like games (but PVE only). I am also a fan of Persona series. I watch ‚öΩÔ∏è and like playing üé±, and sometimes I üö¥ over the weekend(but I'm not good at sports, and I ride slowly). I used to play Yu-Gi-Oh! a lot. And my favorite decks are Lightsworn, Pendulum Magician, Endymion, Virtual World and Sky Striker. Now I only watch videos about Yu-Gi-Oh! online. I'm also exploring other hobbies, like building a website(:lol).

Although I don‚Äôt know how many people will visit this site, since you are here, why not leave a message and probably we can be friends. If you are in Seattle, we may grab a coffee together.

## About this website 

The backend of this site is built with [gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) framework, the database is [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/), the frontend is forked from [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog), and the comment area is supported by [waline](https://waline.js.org/). The code is hosted at https://github.com/Shaddoll/zink.

The trigger for building the website was that I needed something to do to distract myself. The original purpose was probably to practice the Feynman Learning Method. I needed a place to output what I learned. A personal blog is a perfect platform, and I can also learn something in the process of building it. But I didn't think clearly what I would put on this website. Maybe I just wanted to create a hidden corner on the Internet as my own safe haven.
